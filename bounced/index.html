        <h3>Built to get you the files you want, super fast</h3>

          <p>Bounce makes it easy to download movies, music, TV, games or any other kind of file from the people around you, at 10x the speed of BitTorrent.</p>
          <p>We'll even get you files that aren't immediately available to download, by having your friends help in intelligently replicating files you want. If you're interested in how we accomplish such magical feats, read more about our research.</p>

<h3>Free and open-source</h3>

<p>Both our client and server software are completely free and open-source (MIT-licensed), so that you can understand our code and contribute. Send us a pull request, we'd love to have your help.</p>

<h3>Designed for IIIT-Delhi</h3>

<p>There are two kinds of students at IIIT-D: residents and day-scholars. We're bringing them together by making it easy for people in both camps to download stuff from each other. Our replication algorithm helps students who aren't normally online at the same time to easily share files.</p>

<h3>Authors</h3>

<p><a href="http://raghavsethi.org" class="user-mention">@raghavsethi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/navedalam" class="user-mention">@navedalam</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/mayankpundir" class="user-mention">@mayankpundir</a> hated having to walk around with a hard drive asking friends for the latest Ubuntu image, so they built Bounce to do it for them.</p>
          <p>We'd like to thank Dr. Pushpendra Singh and the IIIT-D MUC group, who made this possible.</p>
